        <p>I've owned this RiverFoundry oxford for 8 months now and it's become my go-to work shirt. The fabric is incredibly durable - I wear it 2-3 times a week and it still looks brand new. The trim fit is perfect for my athletic build, sits close to the body without being tight. The reinforced seams are noticeable and give me confidence this will last for years. Highly recommend the slate color - it hides minor stains and looks professional.</p>

        <p>Bought this for my husband who works in construction management. He needed something that could transition from job sites to client meetings. This RiverFoundry shirt delivers perfectly. The oxford fabric is substantial enough to feel professional but breathable enough for outdoor work. After 6 months of regular wear and washing, it's held up remarkably well. The button-down collar stays crisp all day.</p>

        <p>Quality shirt but the sizing runs small. I'm usually a Large but had to exchange for XL. The trim fit is no joke - it's genuinely fitted through the torso and arms. Once I got the right size, it's been excellent. The fabric softens nicely after a few washes but maintains its structure. Good value for the price point, especially with the frequent promotions they run.</p>

        <p>Purchased for my teenage son who needed business casual shirts for his internship. The RiverFoundry workshirt has been perfect - professional enough for the office but not too formal for a 19-year-old. The pre-washed fabric means no shrinkage surprises, and the reinforced seams are holding up well to frequent washing. The chest pocket is practical for pens/cards. Will definitely buy more colors.</p>

        <p>The shirt quality is good but I was disappointed with the fit. Despite reading reviews about the trim cut, I didn't size up enough. The shirt pulls across my chest and the sleeves feel restrictive. The fabric itself is nice - substantial oxford weave that feels like it will last. Just wish I had ordered XXL instead of XL. Customer service was helpful with the exchange process though.</p>

        <p>My husband is extremely picky about his work clothes, and this RiverFoundry oxford has become his favorite. He appreciates that it maintains a crisp appearance even after long days at the office. The 2% elastane gives just enough stretch for comfort without compromising the structured look. He's ordered three more in different colors. The white and sky blue are particularly sharp.</p>

        <p>Solid workshirt that lives up to the RiverFoundry reputation for durability. I work in facilities management and need shirts that can handle both office meetings and hands-on work. This oxford strikes the right balance. The fabric is thick enough to feel substantial but not so heavy that it's uncomfortable. Only complaint is the collar can feel a bit stiff when new, but it breaks in after a few wears.</p>

        <p>Bought this for my husband who's hard on clothes. He works as an engineer and travels frequently. This RiverFoundry shirt has been through countless washings, airport security, and long days, and it still looks great. The trim fit works perfectly under suit jackets for travel, and the reinforced construction means no worry about seams splitting with luggage handling. Worth every penny.</p>

        <p>Good quality oxford shirt but the trim fit is very trim. I'm 6'2" with a 42" chest and the Large fits like a Medium from other brands. The fabric quality is excellent - you can feel the difference in the weave compared to cheaper oxfords. It's held its shape and color beautifully over 4 months of regular wear. Just order a size up from your usual.</p>

        <p>This is my third RiverFoundry oxford - they've become my uniform for work. As a project manager, I need something that looks professional but can handle the occasional job site visit. The reinforced seams are a game-changer - I've never had one fail, even with heavy use. The slate color is particularly versatile - goes with everything and hides minor wear. Definitely recommend for anyone needing durable work shirts.</p>
